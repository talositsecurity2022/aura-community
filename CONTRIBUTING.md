# **Contributing to Aura**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Aura\! We are building a compassionate, altruistic AI companion, and we believe that community involvement is the heart of this mission.

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the **Aura Community Edition**, which is the open-source core of the Aura project.

## **The "Open Core" Model**

Aura operates on an "Open Core" model to balance our altruistic mission with long-term sustainability.

* **Aura Community Edition (This Repository):** The core frontend application is, and always will be, free and open-source under the **MIT License**. We welcome contributions to this part of the project. This includes the UI, persona logic, accessibility features, and localization.  
* **Aura Plus (Proprietary):** Advanced features, such as long-term memory, a personal insights dashboard, and other backend services, are part of our sustainable "Plus" offering. The code for these features is proprietary and is managed in a separate, private repository.

By contributing to this repository, you are helping to improve the free tool that is available to everyone.

## **How to Contribute**

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug reports to new features and translations.

1. **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open a detailed "Issue" on GitHub. Include steps to reproduce the issue, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened.  
2. **Suggesting Features:** Have an idea? Open an "Issue" and tag it as an "enhancement." We would love to hear your thoughts on how to make Aura more helpful.  
3. **Submitting Code Changes:**  
   * Fork this repository.  
   * Create a new branch for your feature (git checkout \-b feature/AmazingNewFeature).  
   * Make your changes.  
   * Submit a "Pull Request" with a clear description of your changes and why you made them.
